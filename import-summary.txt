ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitattributes
* .gitignore
* .idea\
* .idea\compiler.xml
* .idea\copyright\
* .idea\copyright\profiles_settings.xml
* .idea\misc.xml
* .idea\workspace.xml
* ImgApp.png
* ImgWeb.png
* LICENSE
* README.md
* ant.properties
* build.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* bin\res\ => app\src\androidTest\res\
* libs\ant-zip.jar => app\libs\ant-zip.jar
* libs\commons-io-2.4.jar => app\libs\commons-io-2.4.jar
* libs\jangod-core.jar => app\libs\jangod-core.jar
* libs\zxing-core.jar => app\libs\zxing-core.jar
* proguard-project.txt => app\proguard-project.txt
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* src\temp\ => app\src\main\java\
* src\test\ => app\src\main\java\
* src\upload\ => app\src\main\java\
* src\zxing\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
